                Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
                population with some countries and entities actively fighting against
                its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the
                fort. Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of
                tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some
                quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to
                the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down
                that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their
                followers and have them download an app, buy into the social currency
                of their favourite person and watch their investment as is with other
                crypto currency project. We are trying to do to this space what
                investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are
                gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard
                to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the
                "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real
                look.

                A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as
                countries and creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that
                conventional social media platforms can offer. There would be new
                markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home
                there. Like Kanye said,
